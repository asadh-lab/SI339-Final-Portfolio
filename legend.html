						<h2>Legendary Creatures That May Exist!</h2>
							<p>From time to time, around the world there are reports of sightings of creatures that are less than
								human.
								Creatures of
								legend that
								have only been written about in folklore and fiction, only theorized to exist. However some
								of
								these
								mysterious
								creatures may not be legends afterall…. For those of you who are rolling your eyes I implore
								you
								to keep an
								open
								mind.
								Afterall it wasn’t long ago that Gorillas were thought to be creatures of legend. During the
								1600s an
								English
								sailor,
								Andrew Battle on an expedition in West Africa described two man-like apes that would visit
								his
								campsite at
								the
								dead of
								night. It wasn’t until the late 1800s that Gorillas were formally discovered by the
								scientific
								community.
								With
								that
								being said are any of these mysterious cryptids waiting to be discovered?</p>

						<h2>Merfolk</h2>
						<p>For as long as man has been able to sail, reports of aquatic life resembling humans have
							proliferated.
							What’s especially
							interesting is reports of such creatures appearing in multiple cultures worldwide, including
							Europe,
							Asia, Africa, and
							the far East. These legends range from beautiful maidens to dark omens who drag sailors to their
							death.
							While tales of
							such creatures are probably highly romanticized in legend, scientifically speaking such aquatic
							forms of
							human life
							aren’t impossible. Perhaps a missing link in the evolutionary chain?.

						<h2> Mongolian Death Worm</h2>
						<p>There’s good reason to believe the mongolian death worm of legend might actually be real. The
							creature is
							said to
							inhabit the sands of the Gobi desert in northwest Mongolia and China. Legends in the region tell
							the
							tale of a massive
							acid spitting worm-like creature that can reach a staggering 1.5 meters or 5 feet in length. The
							first
							scientific
							documentation of the legend appeared in 1926 by anthropologist Roy Andrews. Since then several
							expeditions have been
							dispatched to the desert in search of the legendary creature. While no conclusive evidence has
							been
							found the Gobi
							desert is so vast it's not unfathomable that such a creature may be lurking under its hot sands.

						<h2>Kongamato</h2>
						<p>The Kangamato is a flying beaked reptilian creature that first appeared in East Central African
							legend.
							Resembling the
							pterodactyl,the name literally translates to overwhelmed boats, as such pterodactyl-like
							creatures
							are
							known to actively
							prey on people crossing rivers and swamps. As recently as 1958 the scientific journalist Maurice
							Burton
							wrote about
							pterodactyl sightings in the Congo prompting speculation that perhaps such creatures may
							actually be
							prehistoric
							animals.</p>

						<h2>Mapinguari</h2>
						<p>Several Amazonian tribal legends tell the story of the Mapinguari, a  vicious, giant, sloth-like creature.
							Interestingly
							enough the
							Mapinguari’s description is so consistent and well described by several isolated native tribes in the
							amazon
							that
							have no contact
							with another. This has prompted some scientists to organize expeditions to find the creature to
							no
							luck.
							Unlike Bigfoot
							who is said to flee human contact, the Mapinguari is a creature of terror that is known to prey
							on
							unfortunate souls
							lost in the Amazon’s dense foliage. Sightings of the Mapinguari persist to this day including
							farmers
							who claim the
							creature will eat their cattle in the dead of night. Interestingly enough giant sloths did once roam the Earth as you'll learn about in the next section, so its not inconceivable that such creatures still exist.</p>

						<h2>Loch Ness Monster</h2>
						<p>The infamous loch ness monster, or Nessie as locals affectionately call him, has been sighted
							since
							as
							early as 565 AD!
							The loch ness monster most closely resembles the plesiosaur which has been said to be extinct
							for a
							millennium….or at
							least officially. The plesiosaur was said to be able to reach 15 meters (49 feet) in length
							which is
							scary accurate to
							eye witness accounts of Nessie. While sightings of the creature are few and far between there
							was a
							recent spike in
							sightings in 2017, leading many to wonder what lies beneath the surface.</p>

						<h2>Kraken</h2>
						<p>Of all the creatures that may exist on this list, the Kraken is perhaps the most probable. You
							may
							have
							noticed alot of the creatures on this lost are aquatic. That's because as surprising
							as it may sound
							it is easier for us to land a person on the moon then the ocean floor, and in today’s world 80%
							of
							the
							world’s oceans
							remain unexplored. So who knows what may lurk in the depths of the ocean. Sailor tales depicting
							a
							squid-like creature
							attacking vessels is the stuff of nightmares. Giant squids have been known to reach lengths of
							up to
							59
							feet. So the
							kraken isn’t as far of a stretch as one might imagine.</p>

						<h2>Yeti</h2>

							folklore,
							much of the
							himalayan wilderness remains unexplored. Several footprints of mysterious bipedal creatures have
							been
							discovered and
							well documented. So is the Yeti a creature of legend or a mysterious creature roaming the
							mountains
							waiting to be
