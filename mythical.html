				<h2>Mythical Creatures that actually Existed!</h2>
			</header>
			<article class="Main">
				<h3>Dragons</h3>
				<p>It couldn't breath fire or fly, but the megalania(aka Devil Dragon) was the largest terrestrial
					lizard
					that
					ever existed,
					and is believed to be the ancestor of the modern komodo dragon. The creature could extrete a
					venomous
					toxin from its
					oral glands, and was known to eat large sized mammals and giant marsupials. The megalania could
					exceed
					lengths of 26
					feet and likely competed with early indigenous settlers of Australia, perhaps contributing to their
					eventual extinction.
				</p>
				<h3>Imugi</h3>
				<p>The Imugi, also known as the korean dragon, was for years thought to be the stuff of legends. It was
					thought that such a
					creature could never exist, that is until the python was actually discovered in South America. Now
					extinct, the Giant
					titanoboa could grow up to 46 feet long and weighed over a ton. In 2012 a life size model of the
					creature was displayed
					in Grand Central station in New York.
				</p>
				<h3>Amazonian Warriors</h3>
				<p>Greek legends and popular superhero Wonder Woman have popularized the notion of the Amazonian in pop
					culture. Legendary
					warriors exclusively made up of women. As it turns out such a tribe did exist in Asia minor.
					Skeletal
					remains of battle
					hardened damaged female warriors were discovered in Eurasia, buried with bows, arrows, and other
					weaponry. Whether
					you’re a fan of Xena Warrior Princess or an admirer of history this is an extremely interesting
					find.
					You can read more
					about the warriors in this <a href=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2020/05-06/fierce-amazons-more-than-myth-real/><i>National Geographic Article</i></a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Berserkers</h3>
				<p>Northern European legends tell the tale of legendary warriors who fought in uncontrollable
					trance-like
					fury. Their
					legendary conquests lend credence to the english phrase “Going Berserk.” As it turns out such
					warriors
					did in fact exist
					and fought in battle among vikings. These Juggernauts dominated the battlefield by either working
					themselves into a
					frenzy or taking intoxicating drugs before embarking on the battlefield.
				</p>
				<h3>Hobbits</h3>
				<p>In 2004 the skeletal remains of Homo floresiensis were discovered in the Indonesian island of Flores
					dating back about
					18,000 years ago. Each of the nine skeletons was only about 3 feet tall and had skulls about one
					third
					the size of
					normal humans. Sounds like something straight out of a Tolkien novel
				</p>
				<h3>Dracula</h3>
				<p>It may come as a shock to many, but the infamous vampire was based on an actual person who lived less
					than 500 years
					ago. Vlad the impaler or Vlad Dracula was a bloodthirsty romania prince who would torture and kill
					his
					enemies by
					impaling them. He was also known to consume the blood of his victims. Anecdotes of his cruel
					campaigns
					and deathly
					demeanor spread throughout Germany and Italy later inspiring the famous 1897 novel Dracula. Vlad was
					eventually killed
					in a military campaign against the Ottoman Empire in January 1477. You can learn more about the real life Dracula in the history documentary to the right.
				</p>
				<h3>Giant sloths/Mapinguari?</h3>
				<p>The most recent discovery on this list was the fact that giant sloths with wolverine claws used to
					roam
					America and
					fought with ancient humans! Fossil evidence uncovered in the sands of New Mexico revealed the
					particularly curious tale
					of such creatures. The giant sloth footprints were discovered alongside human footprints suggesting
					that
					early humans
					were closely stalking the beast in search of food. You can read more about the discovery in this
					Smithsonian article. Given all this its not inconceivable that perhaps the Mapinguari might be out
					there
					somewhere. You can learn more about these mysterious sloth creatures in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/04/25/giant-ground-sloths-ancient-human-hunting/549810002/"><i>this usatoday article</i></a>. And this <a href=https://www.livescience.com/56762-giant-ground-sloth.html><i>Live science article</i></a>.
