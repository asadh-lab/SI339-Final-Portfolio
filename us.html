				<h2>US Folklore and Myths</h2>
				<p>
					In this final section I thought it would be interesting to take a look at some local US folklore and
					urban legends. Perhaps the most famous being that of Bigfoot or the sasquatch. Appearing in both
					Canadian and American folklore, the sasquatch is an ape like creature said to inhabit forest
					environments. The most famous documented evidence for the creature is the Patterson-Gimlin film, a
					short video taken in 1967 in Northern California by filmmaker Roger Patterson. While many skeptics
					are quick to claim its a man in a suit, others have keenly noted that based on the physiological
					makeup of the creature it appeared to be a female and pregnant. That is an impressive amount of
					nuance if the creature is indeed a man in a suit. Most scientists discounted the existence of
					bigfoot and consider all theevidence to be misidentification, hoax, and folklore. Nevertheless,
					based on the sheer size of the territory it inhabits as well as the creatures alleged practice of
					burying its dead, we may never definitively be able to disprove such a creatureâ€™s existence.

				<p>
					The Mothman is a creature in West Virginia folklore that has a grotesque figure and glowing red
					eyes. The creature was first sighted by two young couples on November 15, 1966. The pair of couples
					were driving past an abandoned World War II munitions plant when they sighted the creature. It
					immediately gave chase and stalked their car from the sky at an amazing speed. When questioned
					separately by the local sheriff amazingly all of them gave similar accounts and depictions of the
					creature. Since then several other sightings of the creature have appeared around the area and the
					Mothman is now a staple of the town. The Mothman has become a major tourist attraction and several
					museums and tourist themed stores celebrate the legend. You can actually watch the episode of
					Buzzfeed unsolved below where Shane and Ryan visit the town and locals and uncover the mystery of
					the Mothman.
				</p>
				<p>
					Navajo legends tell the story of the skin-walker. A harmful witch that has the ability to possess,
					or disguise themselves as animals. Animals associated with such creatures include coyotes and
					wolves. There is a tract of land today known as skinwalker ranch in which the owners reportedly
					sight the creatures a couple times each year. Today Skinwalkers remain an integral part of American
					mythology.
